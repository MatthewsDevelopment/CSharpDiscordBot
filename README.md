# CSharp Discord Bot

CSharp Discord Bot is a free and open sourced Discord bot written in C# that allows you to create tags for your server (similar to what Dyno has). This bot does includes a few other utility commands.

This is my first ever project that is written in C#. This bot uses Discord.NET. This source code is responsible for my Discord bot called M X E S#8129.

This project was tested and confirmed working on Dotnet 7.0 and 8.0. The .csproj file has been set to 7.0. You will need to edit TargetFramework in Program.csproj to use a different Dotnet version.
